{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:metapreg} is a routine for meta-analysis of proportions 
from binomial data in the frequentist and bayesian framework. 
The binomial distribution is used to model the within-study variability ({help metapreg##Hamza2008:Hamza et al. 2008}). 
The weighting is implicit and proportional to the study size and within-study variance. 

{pstd}
The program fits a fixed, random-effects, or a mixed-effects model 
assuming binomial, common-rho beta-binomial or binomial-normal distribution with a logit, loglog or the cloglog link to the data.

{pstd}
A random- or mixed-effects model accounts for and allows the quantification of heterogeneity between 
(and within) studies while a fixed-effects model assumes homogeneity between the studies. 
By default, the exact binomial distribution is used when there are less than {cmd:3} studies. 

{pstd}
When there are no covariates, heterogeneity is quantified using the I-squared measure({help metapreg##ZD2014:Zhou and Dendukuri 2014}). 

{pstd}
The command requires {cmd:Stata 14.1} or later versions. {cmd:Stata 16.1} or later versions is required to perform the bayesian analysis.

{pmore}
{cmd:design(comparative)} notifies the program that the data is from comparative studies i.e. 
there are two rows of data per each {cmd: studyid}. The first row has the index/treatment data and the second row has the control data.
The required {it:{vars}} has the form {cmd: n N bicat} 
where {it:bicat} is the first covariate which should be a string or labelled numeric variable with two levels. 

{pmore}
{cmd:design(mpair)} notifies the program that the data is from paired-matched studies. 
The program expects atleast {cmd: a b c d} to be is supplied. 
In the dataset, each row contains data from each seperate cross-tabulation between the index and the control group. 

{pmore}
{cmd:design(mcbnetwork)} notifies the program that the data is from matched studies and instructs to perform contrast-based network meta-analysis. 
In the dataset, each row contains data from each seperate cross-tabulation between the index and the control group. 
There can be more than one row of data per each {cmd: studyid}. The required {it:{vars}} has the form {cmd: a b c d index comparator}. 
{cmd: index comparator} are the first two covariates and both should be string or labelled numeric variables. {cmd:index} should have atleast two levels.
When there are matched observations from each study, the proportions are correlated. The confidence intervals for the individual studies are computed accounting for this correlation. 

{pmore}
{cmd:design(pcbnetwork)} indicates that the data is from paired studies and instructs to perform contrast-based network meta-analysis. There can be more than one row of data per each {cmd: studyid}. The required {it:{vars}} has the form {cmd: ab ac N index comparator}.
{cmd: index comparator} are the first two covariates and both should be string or labelled numeric variables. {cmd:index} should have atleast two levels.
{cmd: pcbnetwork} data is actually aggregated {cmd: matched} data where {cmd: ab = a + b}, {cmd: ac = a + c} and 
{cmd: n = a + b + c + d}. Because the {cmd: a b c d} is not available, there is unfortunately no way to account 
for the correlation when computing the confidence intervals for the individual studies.

{pmore}
{cmd:design(abnetwork)} instructs the program to perform arm-based network meta-analysis. 
The rquired {it:{vars}} has the form {cmd: n N cat} where {it:cat} is the 
first covariate which should be a string or labelled numeric variable with atleast two levels. 
There should be atleast two rows of data per {cmd:studyid}. In this design we view the treatments assigned in a study as nested factors within a study. 
The fitted models assumes exchangeability of the treatments effects and that the missing treatments are missing at random (MAR). 

{marker design_options}{...}
{pmore2}
{it: designopts}: {cmd:baselevel(string)}, {cmd:cov(covtype)}. These options are relevant in comparative and abnetwork model. 

{pmore2}
{cmd: baselevel(string)} Speficies the label of the reference level of the covariate of interest. 
The default is the first category in the dataset. Usage example {cmd:design(abnetwork, baselevel(label))}.

{pmore2}
{cmd: cov(covtype)} specifies the parameterization of the variance-covariance structure of the random-effects. {it:covtype} is one of the following;
{cmd:independent}, {cmd:unstructured}, {cmd:commonint}, {cmd:commonslope} and {cmd:freeint}. 

{pmore3}
{com:cov(independent)} is the default and  
assumes that event probabilities in the control group and treatment effects are independently normally distributed.

{pmore3}
{com:cov(unstructured)} assumes that event probabilities in the control groups and treatment effects are dependently normally distributed

{pmore3}
{com:cov(commonint)} assumes that event probabilities in the control groups are homogeneous and treatment effects are normally distributed

{pmore3}
{com:cov(commonslope)} assumes that event probabilities in the control groups are normally distributed and the treatment effect is homogeneous.

{pmore3}
{com:cov(freeint)} assumption-free control group event probabilities and normally distributed treatment effects.

{marker Inference}{...}
{dlgtab:Inferential Approch}
{synoptline}
{pmore}
{cmd: inference(frequentist)} Frequentist statistics represent the frequency of outcomes under long sequences of hypothetical trials.
In this approach, maximum likelihood estimation is used to obtain the model parameters. 
{helpb meqrlogit} or {helpb melogit} is used for the random-effects model and {helpb binreg} for the fixed-effects model. 
After fitting a random-effects, the posterior distributions are simulated 
to propagate uncertainity about the estimates({help metapreg##GH2007:Gelman and Hill 2006}). 

{pmore}
{cmd: inference(bayesian)} Bayesian statistics offer both practical utility and arguably greater interpretability.

{pmore}
The Bayesian approach is particularly advantageous when handling small study sizes, zero-event studies, 
and between-study heterogeneity across few studies. The Bayesian framework enhances estimation by incorporating weakly informative prior distributions based on plausible assumptions 
and yielding full posterior distributions for model parameters.

{pmore}
When a correlation between random effects is modeled, the inverse Wishart prior is applied, 
otherwise, an inverse-gamma prior (shape and scale = 0.01) is used for variance parameters. 
The inverse-gamma prior is conditionally conjugate for the variance components. 
Conjugacy enhances computational efficiency and numerical stability.

{pmore}
The default priors for the mean components are normal distributions with mean 0 and variance 10 i.e. N(0,10).
This corresponds to an OR centered at 1, reflecting an assumption of no treatment effect, or proportion centered at 0.5, 
reflecting an assumption of equal probability of success of event and no-event.

{pmore}
{helpb bayesmh} is used.

{marker modeltype}{...}
{dlgtab:Model}
{synoptline}
{pmore}
{opt model(type, modelopts)} specifies the type of model to fit. {it:type} is either {cmd:fixed}, {cmd:random}, {cmd:mixed}, {cmd:hexact}, or {cmd:crbetabin}. 

{pmore}
{cmd:model(hexact)} uses the exact binomial distribution. The model assumes that the studies are homogeneous. In {cmd:comparative} studies, the option instructs the 
program to perform exact logistic regression. This option is only feasible in the {cmd:frequentist} estimation approach. 
In a meta-analysis of rare events with few studies, the exact logistic regression model may provide 
more accurate inferences than the standard maximum-likelihood-based logistic regression estimator. 

{pmore}
{cmd:model(fixed)} fits a fixed-effects regression model to the data. The model assumes absence of between-study variability.

{pmore}
{cmd:model(random)} fits a random-effects model e.g. the logistic-normal regression model be fitted to the data when logit (default) link is specified.  

{pmore}
{cmd:model(mixed)} is synonymous to {cmd:model(random)}.  

{pmore}
{cmd:model(crbetabin)} fits common-rho beta-binomial distribution to the data. This requires the installation of the {search betabin}
This option is only feasible in the {cmd:frequentist} estimation approach. 
 
{pmore}
{opt modelopts} specifies the options that give the user
more control on the optimization process. The appropriate options 
feed into the {cmd:binreg}(see {it:{help binreg##maximize_options:maximize_options}}) when {cmd:model(fixed)}, 
{cmd:meqrlogit} (see {it:{help meqrlogit##maximize_options:maximize_options}} and 
{it:{help meqrlogit##laplace:integration_options}}) or {cmd:melogit} (see {it:{help melogit##maximize_options:maximize_options}}) for stata version 16 or higher. 
when {cmd:model(mixed)}, {cmd:betabin}(see {it:{help betabin##betabin_maximize}} when {cmd:model(crbetabin)}), or {cmd:bayesmh} (see {it:{help bayesmh##options_table}})
when {cmd:inference(bayesian)}

{pmore}
In the frequentist approach, the fixed-effects model is maximized using Stata's {help ml} command. This implies that
{cmd: irls} is inadmissible option and {cmd: ml} is implicit. Examples, {cmd: model(random, intpoint(9))} to increase the integration points, 
{cmd: model(random, technique(bfgs))} to specify Stata's BFGS maximiztion algorithm.

{marker linkfunction}{...}
{dlgtab:Link functions}
{synoptline}
{pmore}
{cmd:link(link)} specifies the function to transform the probabilities to a continuous scale that is unbounded. {it:link} is one of the following: {cmd:logit}, {cmd:loglog} and {cmd:cloglog}.

{pmore}
{cmd:link(logit)} is the default link function resulting to the logistic regression i.e. {it: p = exp(xb)/(1 + exp(xb))}.

{pmore}
{cmd:link(loglog)} request the use of the log-log link i.e. {it:p = exp(-exp(xb))}.

{pmore}
{cmd:link(cloglog)} request the use of the complementary log-log link i.e. {it:p = 1 - exp(-exp(xb))}.

{pmore} 
The logit link is symmetric because the probabilities approach zero or one at the same rate. 
The log-log  and complementary log-log  links are asymmetric. Complementary log-log link approaches zero slowly and one quickly. Log-log link approaches zero quickly and one slowly. 
Either the log-log or complementary log-log link will tend to fit better than logistic and are frequently used when the probability of an event is small or large. The reason that logit is so prevalent is because logistic parameters can be interpreted as odds ratios.
When the complementary log-log model holds for the probability of a success, the log-log model holds for the probability
of a failure.

The {it:icitype} for proportions is one of the following; {cmd:exact}, {cmd:wald}, {cmd:wilson}, {cmd:agresti}, or {cmd:jeffreys}.

{pmore2}
{opt exact} is the default for proportions and requests exact/Clopper-Pearson binomial confidence intervals.
The intervals are based directly on the binomial distribution unlike the Wilson score or Agresti-Coull. Their actual
coverage probability can be more than nomial value. This conservative nature of the interval means that they are widest, especially with 
small sample size and/or extreme probilities.

{pmore2}
{opt wald} requests for the Wald confidence intervals based on the quantiles from a normal distribution. 

{pmore2}
{opt wilson} requests for Wilson confidence intervals. 
Compared to the Wald confidence intervals, Wilson score intervals; 
have the actual coverage probability close to the nominal value
and have good properties even with small sample size and/or extreme probilities.
However, the actual confidence level does not converge to the nominal level as {it:n}
increases.

{pmore2}
{opt agresti} requests the Agresti-Coull({help metapreg##AC1998:Agresti, A., and Coull, B. A. 1998}) confidence intervals

The model does not converge, the point estimates and standard errors 
are {cmd:excessively large} or {cmd:undefined}. This occurs because 
the event probabilities are/close to zero and therefore, 
the likelihood function is almost flat, indicating limited information from the 
data about the parameters of interest. Consequently,

{cmd :2.2.6 BCG Vaccination - Interaction between covariates}

{pmore2}
With {help metareg}, {help metapreg##Sharp1998:Sharp (1998)} investigaged the effect of latitude on BCG vaccination. 
The analysis suggested that BCG vaccination was more effective at higher absolute latitude.

{pmore2}
We now fit a logistic regression model with {cmd:bcg}, a categorical variable for the arm and {cmd:lat}, a continous variable with absolute latitude. 

{pmore2}
Activated by the option {cmd:interaction}, an interaction term allows to assess whether the log OR for arm vary by absolute latitude. 

{pmore2}
The interaction term from {cmd:metapreg} and the coefficient for lat using {cmd:metareg} as was done by {help metapreg##Sharp1998:Sharp (1998)} are equivalent.

Using {help metan}, {help metapreg##Chaimani_etal2014:Chaimani et al. (2014)} informaly assessed the difference in treatment effect of haloperidol compared to placebo in treating schizophrenia.
{p_end}

{pmore2}
The analysis is more appropriately perfomed using {cmd:metapreg} by including {cmd:arm} and {cmd:missingdata} as covariates.
